• Worked in a team of three to create an algorithm that would efficiently organize rides within a simulated city.
• Resulting algorithm placed us in the top 100 in the UK.

The task:

Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles, assign the rides to vehicles, so
that riders get to their destinations on time.
For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points proportional to the distance of that ride;
plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely on time.
